Boarding Methods Comparison Project
This project aims to study and compare two boarding methods: the Steffen Boarding Method and the Improved Boarding Method, with the primary goal of improving the boarding process to enhance efficiency and passenger experience.
The importance of this study lies in its ability to provide valuable insights and recommendations to airlines, leading to reduced response times and improved passenger satisfaction. 
This report will conduct a comprehensive analysis of these algorithms, focusing on their efficiency in terms of time and space complexity.
Empirical data will be presented to validate and strengthen the theoretical insights and conclusions derived from the study.
Key Objectives:
Compare the performance of the Steffen Boarding Method and the Improved Boarding Method
Identify the strengths and weaknesses of each method
Provide recommendations to airlines for improving the boarding process
Analyze the time and space complexity of the algorithms
Methodology
Conduct a literature review on the existing boarding methods and their respective performance metrics.
Implement the Steffen Boarding Method and the Improved Boarding Method in a simulation environment.
Gather empirical data by running multiple simulations with varying input parameters (e.g., number of passengers, seat configurations).
Analyze the collected data to assess the efficiency, passenger satisfaction, and other relevant metrics for each boarding method.
Compare the results of the two methods and identify the factors that contribute to their performance.
Provide recommendations for improving the boarding process based on the insights gained from the study.
Expected Outcomes
Detailed comparison of the Steffen Boarding Method and the Improved Boarding Method
Identification of the strengths and weaknesses of each method
Recommendations for airlines to enhance the boarding process
Insights into the time and space complexity of the studied algorithms
